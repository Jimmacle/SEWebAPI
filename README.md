# Command your ships over the internet!
This project is a plugin+mod pair for Space Engineers dedicated servers that allows players to interface with their grids over the internet via a RESTful HTTP interface. Using this API anyone could create a control or monitoring application for Space Engineers such as a control panel on a mobile app or a program that notifies you if your ship is under attack. 

This project will be considered feature complete once it exposes the same features accessible to the Programmable Block but may also add additional features such as a web API for server management.

More information about the usage of this project will be available as it becomes more stable - it's still in very early development and not yet feature complete.
