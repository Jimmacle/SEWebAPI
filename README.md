# Command your ships over the internet!
This project is a plugin+mod pair for Space Engineers dedicated servers that allows players to interface with their grids over the internet via a RESTful HTTP interface. Using this API anyone could create a control or monitoring application for Space Engineers such as a control panel on a mobile app or a program that notifies you if your ship is under attack. More information about the usage of this project will be available as it becomes more stable - it's still in very early development and not yet feature complete.
